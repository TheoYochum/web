                Sport climbing is the more standardized form of climbing and is what will be featured in the Olympics this year. It includes both lead climbing as well as bouldering with various methods of scoring. For both they will generally have pre-set routes that everyone competing will attempt to complete, they get progressively harder as they continue and the further into the route you get the higher you will score. A variety of top roping will also be featured as its own unique genre, speed climbing. Speed climbing utilizes a standardized route which climbers will attempt to make it from the bottom to the top 50 feet away in as little time as possible. The current world record is 5.48 seconds set by Reza Alipour, who climbed the 50 foot wall in under 6 seconds at a speed of about 6.1 miles per hour vertically. <a href="https://www.evorock.com/blog/2019/10/01/everything-you-need-to-know-about-climbing-in-the-2021-olympics/" target="_blank">The 2021 Olympics</a> will feature all 3 events combined into a single format with each competitor required to compete in all three categories and their placing in each being multiplied to determine their final score with the lowest taking first place.
