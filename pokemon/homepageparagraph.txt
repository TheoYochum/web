As a kid I had the standard amount of exposure to pokemon, I watched the original anime and dabled in the card game, but I never played any of the games that were in the original format and only dabled in a Wii game as a kid, the tutorial of which I never figured out how to finish. From my exposure I would say that my favorite pokemon has to be bulbasaur because he is adorable, with pikachu obviously as the runner up. This project seemed like it would offer a lot of creativity for how to approach it due to the sheer amount of data and corresponding styling. Pokemon is a very colorful game and they have already designed a color scheme for you, which allows you to make a really interesting and colorful table with minimal effort.
