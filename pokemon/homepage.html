        <h1>The Pokedex</h1>
        <h2>By Theodore Yochum</h2>
        <p>I have always enjoyed pokemon and as a kid the anime was one of my favorite things to watch, and one of my moms least favorite due to the fact that the pokemon constantly shout their own name over and over. I was never super into the games but they always looked fun. If I had to choose a favorite Gen 1 pokemon it would probably be Bulbasaur with pikachu coming in close second because of course. This project seemed like it would be pretty cool because you are given a lot of different numbers you can mess around with, and most of them have associated colors allowing you to do some pretty fun stuff with the styling. For this project I, made it so that the pokemon types are colored according to the original values, each attribute with a numerical value is colored on a gradient at 20% intervals with the lowest value being the lightest color and the highest being the darkest color, also each entry has a game version column which is colored corresponding to which version of pokemon it appeared in. The few pokemon that have gold colored borders are legendaries. The entire website uses a font that is inteded to replicate the original gameboy font.</p>
