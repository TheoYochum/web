This is a list of all of the pokemon in the first generation, the entire webpage is using a replica gameboy font from <a href="https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/6368/looking-for-a-good-video-game-retro-pixel-like-web-safe-font"> here</a>. Each Pokemon is listed with its number, its name, and its primary and secondary type with the type backgrounds colored according to <a href="https://www.epidemicjohto.com/t882-type-colors-hex-colors"> this website </a>. Each attribute of the pokemon is colored on a gradient from 0 to 1 with 1 being the highest value, for example chansey with 250 health, and 0 being the lowest, diglet with 10 health. There is a linear scale on the gradients and the coloring is done on a 20% interval with the colors getting darker as the value gets higher, the colors were chosen by whatever made sense to me and I eyeballed a gradient that seemed to get progressively darker while retaining the core color. The generation entry of the original data set is replaced by a game version entry with the table cell containing the color of each version of generation 1 the pokemon appeared in, red blue and yellow according to <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-red-blue-yellow-version/Pokemon_Red,_Blue,_and_Yellow_Version_Differences">this website</a>, for exapmple ekans only appeared in pokemon red, while sandshrew appeared in blue and yellow. The legendary entry has been removed entirely as it was false for the vast majority and has been replaced by a gold border on any legendary pokemon. All of these stylings are consistent between type pages.
