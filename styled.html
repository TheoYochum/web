                Rock Climbing is a sport that, like many others has changed and developed drastically over the past decades. As an activity its roots are found in the human mind as no one needed to invent it, humans are just drawn to climbing things out of necessity or for fun. Generally climbing will refer to a person using their arms and legs to climb a rock face that is too steep to do with just your feet. When people refer to climbing a mountain, this will usually refer to a form of hiking or backpacking instead of what is considered climbing as most climbing occurs on a single face or system of rock, which in certain cases may be an entire mountain but, usually is only anywhere from 50 to 200 or so feet high. However, climbing as a sport does have a <a href="https://www.fix.com/blog/moving-from-the-climbing-gym-to-the-outdoors/" target="_blank">few disciplines</a> that will be covered below.

            <p>
                <a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/bouldering.html" target="_blank">Bouldering</a> is one of the most accessible forms of rock climbing that most people are likely experienced with to some extent. As implied by its name, it deals with the climbing of boulders or other rock faces that are generally much smaller. It is not very far and would be reasonable to say that maneuvering yourself on top of a large boulder to sit down is a form of bouldering. It is done without a rope due to the nature of the climbing making the use of one difficult and not very helpful if one was used. It will most often be done on walls or rocks that rarely get any higher than 15-20 feet off the ground. Bouldering can be done both outdoors and in an indoor gym. Gym bouldering can be a very dynamic form of climbing with a lot of variety in how a route is constructed. You are provided with starting points for your hands and feet and given an endpoint you have to reach. A wall will generally consist of multiple routes where you are only allowed to use the holds of a specific color. As previously stated there can be extreme variety in the way a route is constructed, some will start on a flat wall and stay roughly flat the entire way while others will have you at a 45 degree angle the entire time with others even having you climb around the underside of a roughly cylindrical structure. Some routes will have you preforming a "dynamo" aka. a dynamic movement, where you will jump from one hold to another. Outdoor bouldering follows a similar style of very dynamic and diverse movement, however the routes are often much less manufactured as they are made based on what the rock gives you and that is it. This form of climbing tends to be the most accessible and diverse as it will usually only require access to the rock itself, some "crash pads" to act as cushioning if you fall and some friends to climb with.

            <h2 id="toprope">Top Rope/Lead Climbing</h2>
            <p>
                Top rope climbing and lead climbing are very similar and deal with the much larger rocks. They require the use of a harness and a system of one or more ropes as well as a partner to "belay" you up the wall. This style of climbing will be used for any wall higher than what would generally be a survivable fall due to it being safer. Both types include the climber being tied into a rope that goes through an "anchor point" and through the belayer's harness. The belayer will feed the rope through a device attached to their harness that allows the rope through in one direction but not the other unless the belayer themselves allows it, with most using a directional friction system. This allows the belayer to ensure that the rope is as tight as possible and prevent a fall, as if the climber falls of the wall the direction of the belay device will not allow the rope to move and transfers the energy of the fall to the anchors, rope, and some to the belayer although it is almost always not enough to risk the belayer's safety. Top rope climbing has the rope go from the climber up to the top of the route, where it will be attached to some form of anchor whether it be the base of a tree, another rope that itself is anchored, or a variety of other options, the rope will then go down to the belayer and be attached to their harness. Lead climbing has the rope go from the climber down through a series of anchors that the climber clips the rope into as they climb, the rope goes thing rough them to the belayer. Top roping is generally much easier as you do not have to be very aware of where the rope is and you simply climb to the top of the route and then are lowered down however, it is limited by the fact that you need to have access to the top of the route before beginning, and does not work well on routes with under hangs as the rope will attempt to pull you away from the wall. Lead climbing is significantly more advanced but is used most often in advanced outdoor climbing. In lead climbing as you climb you clip the rope into carabiners as you reach them, acting as "checkpoints", if you are the first person to climb a route and there are not already anchors installed, which there rarely are, you will have to place your own as you climb. These anchors are generally referred to as "protection" and come in various shapes and sizes. Most exploit cracks in the rock where you can exploit properties of the geology to put in a mechanism that will be able to resist the force exerted on it by a fall. Lead climbing will be used for most serious outdoor climbing, and can even be used to scale the sides of mountains such as El Capitan and The Half Dome, the former of which someone decided to climb without a rope which is detailed in a great movie: <a href="https://films.nationalgeographic.com/free-solo" target="_blank">"Free Solo"</a>, in Yosemite, where you will have a "multi-pitch" route where you climb in segments bringing all of your rope with you as you do. Top roping is more common in gyms as their walls will tend to be flatter and it allows you to focus on the climbing more, as well as allowing the use of automatic belay systems that automatically pull in slack and can prevent you falling off too fast.

                Sport climbing is the more standardized form of climbing and is what will be featured in the Olympics this year. It includes both lead climbing as well as bouldering with various methods of scoring. For both they will generally have pre-set routes that everyone competing will attempt to complete, they get progressively harder as they continue and the further into the route you get the higher you will score. A variety of top roping will also be featured as its own unique genre, speed climbing. Speed climbing utilizes a standardized route which climbers will attempt to make it from the bottom to the top 50 feet away in as little time as possible. The current world record is 5.48 seconds set by Reza Alipour, who climbed the 50 foot wall in under 6 seconds at a speed of about 6.1 miles per hour vertically. <a href="https://www.evorock.com/blog/2019/10/01/everything-you-need-to-know-about-climbing-in-the-2021-olympics/" target="_blank">The 2021 Olympics</a> will feature all 3 events combined into a single format with each competitor required to compete in all three categories and their placing in each being multiplied to determine their final score with the lowest taking first place.
