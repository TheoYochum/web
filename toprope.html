                Top rope climbing and lead climbing are very similar and deal with the much larger rocks. They require the use of a harness and a system of one or more ropes as well as a partner to "belay" you up the wall. This style of climbing will be used for any wall higher than what would generally be a survivable fall due to it being safer. Both types include the climber being tied into a rope that goes through an "anchor point" and through the belayer's harness. The belayer will feed the rope through a device attached to their harness that allows the rope through in one direction but not the other unless the belayer themselves allows it, with most using a directional friction system. This allows the belayer to ensure that the rope is as tight as possible and prevent a fall, as if the climber falls of the wall the direction of the belay device will not allow the rope to move and transfers the energy of the fall to the anchors, rope, and some to the belayer although it is almost always not enough to risk the belayer's safety. Top rope climbing has the rope go from the climber up to the top of the route, where it will be attached to some form of anchor whether it be the base of a tree, another rope that itself is anchored, or a variety of other options, the rope will then go down to the belayer and be attached to their harness. Lead climbing has the rope go from the climber down through a series of anchors that the climber clips the rope into as they climb, the rope goes thing rough them to the belayer. Top roping is generally much easier as you do not have to be very aware of where the rope is and you simply climb to the top of the route and then are lowered down however, it is limited by the fact that you need to have access to the top of the route before beginning, and does not work well on routes with under hangs as the rope will attempt to pull you away from the wall. Lead climbing is significantly more advanced but is used most often in advanced outdoor climbing. In lead climbing as you climb you clip the rope into carabiners as you reach them, acting as "checkpoints", if you are the first person to climb a route and there are not already anchors installed, which there rarely are, you will have to place your own as you climb. These anchors are generally referred to as "protection" and come in various shapes and sizes. Most exploit cracks in the rock where you can exploit properties of the geology to put in a mechanism that will be able to resist the force exerted on it by a fall. Lead climbing will be used for most serious outdoor climbing, and can even be used to scale the sides of mountains such as El Capitan and The Half Dome, the former of which someone decided to climb without a rope which is detailed in a great movie: <a href="https://films.nationalgeographic.com/free-solo" target="_blank">"Free Solo"</a>, in Yosemite, where you will have a "multi-pitch" route where you climb in segments bringing all of your rope with you as you do. Top roping is more common in gyms as their walls will tend to be flatter and it allows you to focus on the climbing more, as well as allowing the use of automatic belay systems that automatically pull in slack and can prevent you falling off too fast.
