                <a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/bouldering.html" target="_blank">Bouldering</a> is one of the most accessible forms of rock climbing that most people are likely experienced with to some extent. As implied by its name, it deals with the climbing of boulders or other rock faces that are generally much smaller. It is not very far and would be reasonable to say that maneuvering yourself on top of a large boulder to sit down is a form of bouldering. It is done without a rope due to the nature of the climbing making the use of one difficult and not very helpful if one was used. It will most often be done on walls or rocks that rarely get any higher than 15-20 feet off the ground. Bouldering can be done both outdoors and in an indoor gym. Gym bouldering can be a very dynamic form of climbing with a lot of variety in how a route is constructed. You are provided with starting points for your hands and feet and given an endpoint you have to reach. A wall will generally consist of multiple routes where you are only allowed to use the holds of a specific color. As previously stated there can be extreme variety in the way a route is constructed, some will start on a flat wall and stay roughly flat the entire way while others will have you at a 45 degree angle the entire time with others even having you climb around the underside of a roughly cylindrical structure. Some routes will have you preforming a "dynamo" aka. a dynamic movement, where you will jump from one hold to another. Outdoor bouldering follows a similar style of very dynamic and diverse movement, however the routes are often much less manufactured as they are made based on what the rock gives you and that is it. This form of climbing tends to be the most accessible and diverse as it will usually only require access to the rock itself, some "crash pads" to act as cushioning if you fall and some friends to climb with.
